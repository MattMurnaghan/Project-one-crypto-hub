## **User Journey**

### Welcome page - A gentle introduction
---
* This page welcomes the user to the site and defines what a cryptocurrency is, how it affects the economy and what its purpose is in the global economy. 
* The goal of this page is to introduce crypto unambiguously.
* The imagery and text should highlight the collaborative aspect of cryptocurrency and the individuals and groups (countries and companies) that are starting to embrace cryptocurrency as a new legal tender and means of trade.

### Guides - How does it work?
---
* This page defines what a blockchain is, the different ways to buy crypto, how to store it and a few video links to some helpful explanatory videos.
* A visitor should have a basic grasp of what cryptocurrency is now and will be looking to learn about how they can get involved and what to do once they have purchased their crypto.

### Currencies - Popular currency review 
---
* This page goes through some of the most popular currencies and the fundamental differences between them. 
* The first section defines what a whitepaper is to the user and why it is important when it comes to researching different cryptocurrencies to invest in.
* Each section gives an overview of the currency, an explanation of its technology, its place in the market as well as a link to its whitepaper.
* There is a series of video links covering exactly what a whitepaper is as well as each mentioned cryptocurrency at the bottom of the page.
* At this point, a visitor should have a fair grasp on what a blockchain is, how it is fundamental to cryptocurrency, what sort of currencies they can invest in and how to research any new crypto projects that they might be interested in.

### Exchanges - The best places to trade
---
* This page lists some of the most popular exchanges where you can invest and some key details particular to each exchange. 
* It features a pros and cons list for the chosen exchanges and a brief overview of each.
* There are a series of video links covering each exchange and how an exchange works at the bottom of the page.
* Now, a visitor should be informed of how a crypto exchange works and will have directions to four different popular crypto exchange sites where they can begin trading.
 ### Glossary - Terminology explained
 ---
* This page goes through some of the more complicated terms when it comes to investing in crypto. 
* Its purpose is to make it easier for novice investors to make informed decisions about their investments.
* When a visitor arrives at this point, they have learned most of what the site has to offer and will be directed to the contacts page.
* Return users will visit this section most frequently when brushing up on terminology that they do not understand.

### Contact us - Meet like-minded individuals
This page allows site visitors to sign up for a mailing list and connect with other like-minded individuals. It also gives a link to a discord channel where people who sign up can talk about investments and ask questions with their peers.


## **UX**
### Strategy
---
Crypto Hub aims to educate site visitors about cryptocurrency. The site covers the basic technology that allows cryptocurrencies to exist, the different currencies available to invest in, how to purchase and store their crypto and how to research blockchain projects that they are interested in.
To keep in line with core UX principles, I considered the factors listed below:  
### Target Audience
---
The site is aimed at users of all ages, as cryptocurrency is still a mysterious topic for many. However, there is a slight leaning towards users aged 18-30, as these users are typically further willing to invest in newer opportunities, rather than more established stock holdings and investment opportunities.
### Scope
---
In order to achieve the desired user & business goals, the following features will be included in this release:
* Header and responsive menu bar, for easy site navigation on both mobile and desktop views
* Information sections with a similar core layout
* Information on some of the top cryptocurrencies and their backgrounds
* Information on the most popular exchanges, pros and cons lists of their platforms and links to their respective sites
* A glossary section with dropdown menus so as not to overwhelm the user with information
* Video links section explaining the topics covered on each page
* A signup form to subscribe to a mailing list
* A link to a discord server where visitors can connect with like-minded individuals and other site users, looking to discuss crypto-related topics and share their journies

### Structure
---
I chose a multiple-page structure for the site as I felt it was easier to deliver the information in this way. 
The information architecture was designed as such:

Home Page > Guides > Currencies > Exchanges > Glossary > Contact Us

Structuring the information in this way allows site users to learn about cryptocurrency in an intuitive manner and in a way that should feel natural to them:
1. First, a user is introduced to the site and shown some of the benefits of cryptocurrency and that it has a use case in real-world applications.
2. Then a user is introduced to the technology behind cryptocurrency, how they can purchase it and what to do with it once they have some.
3. After this, a user learns which currencies are popular and how to research new projects that interest them.
4. The next section informs a user of what a crypto exchange is as well as the different exchanges that are currently protected under financial regulations and provide links to each one.
5. At this stage, a user is given a summary page with more complicated terminology to help clear up any confusion on certain financial and technological terms that the user may be unclear on.
6. Finally, a user is prompted to sign up to a mailing list where they can be presented with regular information about the crypto space. They can also join a discord server where they can chat with like-minded peers and other site visitors to learn more about crypto and share their investment journeys.

[Wireframes](docs/wireframes/crypto-hub-wireframes.pdf)

Linked above are the wireframes for the site. They show examples of both a desktop and mobile view of the site.
The design has changed slightly in terms of color scheme and layout but has remained mostly the same.

* I added some hover effects to the images on the home page, revealing some interesting facts about crypto when a user mouses over them.

* To implement this same feature on mobile, I made the text boxes permanent and slightly opaque, as there would be no cursor to trigger the effect.

* I added some hover effects to the navbar to give a better sense of feedback to the user. 

* I added a burger menu navbar for mobile users, on the right-hand side, as I felt this was the best way for a user to navigate the site one-handed.

* I also added some animated arrows directing users to the video sections, as well as on the contact us page.

* Originally, the discord link had no text, was circular and contained the discord icon only. However, real user testing showed that not many people realized that this was a clickable link. 

* In response to this, I added the animated arrow as well as a press me element, along with some text directing the user to join the website's discord server. I felt that it gave better direction to the users to click the link and increase engagement.

### Surface
---
I chose a color palette around blues and greens as they have a strong connection to the business world and finance in general (IBM, Facebook, Coinbase etc.).
These colors evoke a psychological response, triggering feelings of calm, security and tranquility, all the perfect feelings to evoke in a user who is new to the crypto-space and quite possibly already skeptical of the subject.

I used a gradient background to distinguish individual sections and create some depth on the page. I used a dark blue/green color with white text for reading sections to provide appropriate contrast. 

I used two different fonts for the site, 'Roboto Slab' for any heading sections and 'Lato' for the body text. See the example below:
![font-pairing](docs/images/surface/font-pair-example.jpg)


## **Features**
---
This website is fully responsive and was designed for desktop first and adapted to fit a mobile view. Sections are broken up into different colored backgrounds following the same information presentation style, to create a sense of familiarity for the user. There are three different layouts on the site, A, B, C and D.
* Layout A is used for the homepage.
* Layout B is used for the guides, currencies and exchanges pages.
* Layout C is used for the glossary page.
* Layout D is used for the contact us page.

## Layout A
### Hero Image 
---
The hero image for the site has a slight zoom effect when loading into the homepage. The image I chose shows someone's hand holding a physical bitcoin, which serves as a metaphor for the user being able to get a grasp of what cryptocurrency is about as well as taking their financial situation into their own hands.


When serving this image to mobile users, I used a .webp image format as the original .jpg was causing too much delay to the page load.  

### Navbar
---
The navbar is a sticky element, placed at the top of the page and stays present when scrolling throughout site navigation. It provides the user with an easy way to navigate back and forth between site pages. 
* The page that the user is currently viewing is marked with an active style and is underlined to keep the user informed of their current position on the site. 
* There is a hover effect added to the rest of the elements with the same underline as the active tag to provide feedback to the user.

|![navbar-desktop](docs/images/features/navbar.jpg)|
|:--:|
| <strong>Navbar - Desktop View</strong>  |

I replaced the navbar with a burger menu opening from the side of the screen for mobile users as I felt this was a more appropriate method of site navigation for that type of device. 

|![navbar-mobile](docs/images/features/navbar-mobile.jpg)|
|:--:|
| <strong>Navbar - Mobile View</strong>  |

The element uses a checkbox with opacity 0 behind a burger menu icon to toggle a media query, hiding the element at the side of the page.

|![navbar-mobile-expanded](docs/images/features/navbar-mobile-expanded.jpg)|
|:--:|
| <strong>Navbar - Mobile view expanded</strong>  |

### Section row
---  
The information section of the home screen presents the user with some different welcome messages to the site. Each section is headed by an H2 element on a colored background, offset against the white background of the site. 
|![home-screen-section-row](docs/images/features/home-screen-images-section.jpg)|
|:--:|
| <strong>Section Row - welcome messages</strong>  |

Alongside the welcome messages are some images. Each image has a hover effect that presents some extra information about crypto to the user when placing the cursor on the image. This effect was implemented by setting a p tag to occupy the same space as the image using a grid layout. The zoom and reveal were implemented using a hover transition effect. 

|![home-screen-image-hover-effect](docs/images/features/home-screen-images-section-hover-effect.jpg)|
|:--:|
| <strong>Section Row - Image hover effect</strong>  |

For mobile, I removed the hover effect for the overlay text on the images and added them as permanent boxes with translucent color backgrounds, due to the lack of a cursor to trigger the effect.

I also shifted the rows and images to sit on top of each other instead of side by side, as this was a better fit for longer mobile screens, vs wider desktop ones.

|![home-screen-mobile-view](docs/images/features/home-screen-images-section-mobile.jpg)|
|:--:|
| <strong>Section Row - Mobile view</strong>  |

### Next Page 
---
A next page link inside of a div element was implemented at the bottom of each page, barring the contact page, to give the user a quick and easy way to progress through the site. There is a hover effect placed on the button to scale up its size when a user places their cursor on it.

|![next-page-element](docs/images/features/next-page.jpg)|
|:--:|
| <strong>Next page element</strong>  |

### Footer 
---
There is also a footer section at the bottom of each page, with four social media links, created using icons from fontawesome inside a tags.

|![next-page-element](docs/images/features/footer.jpg)|
|:--:|
| <strong>Footer element at the bottom of each page</strong>  |

## Layout B
### Guides - Section row
---
The information presentation style for layout B is shared for the mostpart by the guides, currencies and exchanges pages. It consists of a colored row background to break up sections, holding a dark-colored div element, centered on the page and offset with white text for appropriate contrast. 

Each subheader is underlined with an hr tag and uses the same Roboto Slab font shared with the rest of the heading elements throughout the site. 

|![layout-b-section-row](docs/images/features/guides-section-row.jpg)|
|:--:|
| <strong>Layout B - Centered row element</strong>  |

At the bottom of each page for layout B, there is a video links section, using a responsive iframe to show video links on the different topics covered by each section of the page. there is an animated arrow that bobs up and down above this section to draw the attention of the user and encourage them to click and watch the videos.

|![layout-b-video-links](docs/images/features/layout-b-video-links.jpg)|
|:--:|
| <strong>Layout B - Video links</strong>  |

There are some a tag elements below each video as well as a scrollbar with scroll snap properties to allow easy selection of each video. There is a hover effect applied to each selector, changing the color to an off-white background and raising the element when the cursor is placed on it.

## Layout C
### Glossary 
---

This section was created using the center div element style from layout B but has some new dropdown div elements created with the same hidden checkbox method used for the mobile burger menu. Each element is given an aria label to satisfy accessibility standards. when clicked, the element reveals a dropdown section giving a specific explanation for the investment terms listed at the top of the dropdown. 

|![layout-c-glossary-dropdowns](docs/images/features/glossary-section.jpg)|
|:--:|
| <strong>Layout C - Glossary dropdowns</strong>  |


## Layout D

### Form 
---
The final page has a different layout, holding a form element and a discord sign-up link, as well as a privacy statement using the same dropdown element as seen in the glossary section.

|![layout-d-contact-us-section](docs/images/features/contact-us-section.jpg)|
|:--:|
| <strong>Layout D - Contact us section</strong>  |


Each input in the form has an appropriate label and uses CSS to place the label above the input on its border.
There is also a checkbox option to allow the user to receive targeted advertisements about other crypto products and services.

All of this form data is sent with a POST action to the formdump link provided by the code institute and opens in a new tab when submitted. The signup button also changes color when the user hovers over it to provide further feedback.

|![layout-d-form-element](docs/images/features/form-element.jpg)|
|:--:|
| <strong>Layout D - Form element</strong>  |

### Discord Sign up
---
There is also a discord sign-up link with the same animated arrow element from earlier displayed above the video links. When a user hovers over the link, it will scale up and change color, encouraging the user to click on the element.

|![layout-d-discord-sign-up-element](docs/images/features/discord-sign-up-hover-effect.jpg)|

## **Testing**

The typical first-time user on this site is someone with little to no experience in the crypto space. As such, the journey should take a user from a novice position to one who feels they understand the crypto-space enough to begin to invest and explore other associated products.

### User stories

## **Lighthouse Scores**




## **Bug Fixes and Issues**
There were multiple bugs encountered during the development of this project. These were listed along with the methods employed as solutions to each.

### Working with percentages
---
* An issue I found when working with percentages was scaling. 
* When adjusting the zoom/resolution for the site, I found that some of the divs were scaling improperly. They were shrinking to a point where they could not hold their content.
* The title div was changing size and proportion to where it was not consistent with the design theme for the rest of the home page. (See fig. 1 & 2 below)
### Issue


|![percentages bug 1\label](docs/images/percentages/percentages%20bug%20%231.jpg)|
|:--:|
| <strong>Fig.1 Improper scaling when zooming out</strong>  |



|![percentages bug 2](docs/images/percentages/percentages%20bug%20%232.jpg)|
|:--:|
| <strong>Fig.2 Improper scaling when zooming in</strong>  |


### Fix 

* To fix the issue, I started using fixed sizing in pixels for select element widths and heights. 
* I had previously believed that using percentages and vh would be more responsive, but now I can see that using these measurements in the wrong place on a site can create unpredictable site behavior.

### Link paths
---
* An issue I found when launching my site to GitHub pages was that one of my pictures was not loading in correctly.
* I investigated the issue and found that I had referenced the image using relative pathing instead of absolute.

### Issue
|![percentages bug 1\label](docs/images/link-paths/broken-link-1.png)|
|:--:|
| <strong>Fig.3 Image not loading in correctly</strong>  |

### Fix

I updated the link from:
    
        <img id="image-1" class="image"
                        src="/assets/images/women-by-window.jpg"
                        alt="Two women sitting in a chair discussing investment opportunites beside a bright open window.">

And changed it to:

        <img id="image-1" class="image" 
        src="assets/images/women-by-window.jpg" 
        alt="Two women sitting in a chair discussing investment opportunites beside a bright open window.">
                        

Here is the resulting image, loading in correctly
