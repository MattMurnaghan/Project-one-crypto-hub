                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        A Whitepaper is the most important document you would look for when
                        choosing a currency to invest in:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A whitepaper details the the inner workings of a cryptocurrency, its technical details and
                            its purpose.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Whitepapers also tell you who the authors of the currency are and who they are partnered
                            with.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Also commonly found in a whitepaper is a roadmap for the currency, detailing how the project
                            will progress and what its timeline is.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Any sources of funding for the project are also disclosed in the whitepaper.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Whitepapers can come in a variety of forms, some are very long and filled with text, whereas
                            some others can be quite short or show many pictures and instructional graphics.
                        </li>

                        Bitcoin is the worlds most influencial cryptocurrency and is the most often talked about with
                        new retail investors joining the space. Here are some of the main points surrounding it:

                        <li>
                            Bitcoin was originally created by someone using the online handle
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto#:~:text=Satoshi%20Nakamoto%20is%20the%20name,devised%20the%20first%20blockchain%20database."

                                "Satoshi Nakamoto"
                            </a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Its purpose was to create a "peer-to-peer" electronic cash system, essentially acting as
                            digital gold.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The system allows users to issue online payments to each other without needing to rely on a
                            financial institution to faciliate the transaction.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Place in the market</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Bitcoin is the most dominant cryptocurrency in the world and has a lot of sway on the rest
                            of the global market.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Generally, when the price of Bitcoin surges or dips, the other currencies in the market will
                            follow suit.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It has the highest market cap of any cryptocurrency today.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Often, other currencies rate of change can be measured in comparision to bitcoins
                            "dominance", or by how much sway bitcoin currently has over the market.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The origins of bitcoin are still shrowded in mystery.

                            Many people have claimed to be Satoshi, but as of yet, none of these claims have been

                    Smart contracts are one of the most popular kinds of cryptocurrencies in the market aside from
                    Bitcoin.
                </p>
                <h3>What are they?</h3>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A smart contract is a computer program that fulfills a contract online, automatically.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It can be used to process payments, purchases and many other services, such as borrowing,
                        lending and trading in the financial industry.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Smart contracts are distributed and immutable, meaning they cannot be changed, as we discussed
                        previously when explaining what a blockchain system is.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Because a smart contract cannot be tampered with, all parties involved can be fully assured that
                        the terms of the aggreement will be met.
                    </li>

                <p>Some popular examples of successful smart contract crypto projects are:</p>

                    <li>
                        There are plenty of players in the smart contract game, but we will only be looking at the most

                        Ethereum is a crypto project created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin"

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        Ethereum has a broader usecase than Bitcoin, as it is a platform that allows users to host Dapps (Decentralised applications).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A Dapp usually consists of a collection of smart contracts, working in tandem to carry out a function for the user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Anyone can write a Dapp using Ehtereum's programming languasge, Solidity, and host it on the Ethereum network.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The currency that incetivises people to use the Ethereum network is called Ether, or ETH, and this is what is traded in the crypto market-space.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Place in the market</h3>

                    <li>
                        Ether is the second most dominant cryptocurrency in the world. It too has a lot of sway on the market, but not as much as bitcoin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ether has been the most dominant smart contract cryptocurrency for a long time, essentially since its conception.

                <h3>Origins</h3>

                    <li>
                        The Ethereum network was concieved in 2013 and launched in 2014.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For a time it enjoyed a market almost devoid of competion until co-founder Charles Hoskinson left the network in 2014 due to differences of opinion regarding the direction of the network.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In 2017, Hoskinson founded Cardano, a network he believed would surpass Ethereum and deliver a better quality of service.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        in 2015, co-founder Gavin Wood left Ethereum, starting his own blockchain software development company with Jutta Steiner, former chief of secuirty at the Ethereum foundation. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In May 2020, Wood launched Polkadot, another smart contract network, built using different methodoligies to rival Ethereum and solve some of the issues with transaction speeds on the network.

                    Stable coins are now a very important part of the crypto market-space. They allow ivestors to retain the value of their trades and minimise risk and volatility.
                </p>
                <h3>What are they?</h3>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A stable coin is a cryptocurrency that is pinned to a real world (fiat) currency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As the value of the coin is pinned to fiat currencies like the dollar, their value is always stable around 1 unit of the respective currency it is backed by.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This is important as it allows users to retain the value of any profits they have made on their investments, without having to convert their crypto back into fiat currency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The reason this is so important is that stablecoins are still classed as assets, not currency.

                        Without them, the only way to hold a stable value would be to sell your crypto, which can incur heavy taxes, depending on your location and reulatory laws around cryptocurrency.
