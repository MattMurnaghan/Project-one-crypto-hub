                    <hr>
                    <p>
                       A Whitepaper is the most important document you would look for when
                        choosing a currency to invest in:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A whitepaper details the the inner workings of a cryptocurrency, its technical details and its purpose.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Whitepapers also tell you who the authors of the currency are and who they are partnered with.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Also commonly found in a whitepaper is a roadmap for the currency, detailing how the project will progress and what its timeline is.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Any sources of funding for the project are also disclosed in the whitepaper.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Whitepapers can come in a variety of forms, some are very long and filled with text, whereas some others can be quite short or show many pictures and instructional graphics.
                        </li>

                        Bitcoin is the worlds most influencial cryptocurrency and is the most often talked about with new retail investors joining the space. Here are some of the main points surrounding it:
                    </p>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Bitcoin is a crypto project created by Satoshi Nakamoto
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Its purpose was to create a "peer-to-peer" electronic cash system, essentially acting as digital gold.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The system allows users to issue online payments to each other without needing to rely on a financial institution to faciliate the transaction.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Place in the market</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Bitcoin is the most dominant cryptocurrency in the world and has a lot of sway on the rest of the global market.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Generally, when the price of Bitcoin surges or dips, the other currencies in the market will follow suit.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It has the highest market cap of any cryptocurrency today.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Often, other currencies rate of change can be measured in comparision to bitcoins "dominance", or by how much sway bitcoin currently has over the market.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Origins</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The origins of bitcoin are still shrowded in mystery. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Bitcoin was originally created by someone using the online handle "Satoshi Nakamoto".
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Many people have claimed to be Satoshi, but as of yet, none of these claims have been verified.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    Smart contracts are one of the most popular kinds of cryptocurrencies in the market aside from Bitcoin.
                </p>
                <h3>What are they?</h3>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A crypto wallet works like a physical wallet. It is a safe place where users store their
                        cryptocurrency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A users cryptocurrency is stored in a digital address on the blockchain with special
                        (digital) keys required to access them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        These addresses and keys are provided by the wallet. A crypto wallet can be device, web
                        (internet), or hardware based.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Hot Wallets</h3>
                <hr>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Hot Wallets are crypto wallets that have a connection to the internet. These can be device
                        based (computer or mobile) or web based (online).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Online wallets, are accessible through the web and are managed by an online service.
                        Coinbase, Electrum and Mycelium are a few popular choices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While hot wallets are very convinient and provide access to your crypto from anywhere with
                        an internet connection, there can be security concerns.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Accessing a hot wallet on an internet connection that is not secure may result in having
                        your cryptocurrency stolen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is a good idea to avoid accessing a hot wallet from a public internet connection whenever
                        possible, unless you are sure it is safe!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cold Wallets</h3>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Cold wallets are the simplest and safest way to store your cryptocurrency whilst protecting
                        it from potential attack.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A cold wallet is not connected to the internet and is therefore far less likely to be
                        compromised by a third party.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A cold wallet stores the user's blockchain address and private key in one place and allow
                        them to view their wallet using software that protects their key.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cold wallets are often stored on USB keys and are plugged into a computer to use them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A paper wallet involves the user printing off their private address and keys on a physical
                        piece of paper. Often they are laminated and stored in safety deposit boxes or banks.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Extra security</h3>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Be careful when using cold wallets:</strong> If a user was to lose a cold wallet or
                        its respecting address or keys, there is no way to regain access to your funds. Always make
                        regular backups of your cold wallets to ensure security!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Always keep the software on your devices up to date if you are accessing your wallet using
                        them. Devices running on old software will be an easier target for hackers and malware.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Multi signature wallets allow for transactions to require multiple wallets to sign a
                        transaction. These are especially useful when managing a shared fund, as all parties
                        involved must be in agreement and present when transfering funds.
                    </li>
