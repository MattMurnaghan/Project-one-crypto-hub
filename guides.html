                        <strong>Financial Apps</strong> - Apps like PayPal or Venmo in the US, allow users to purchase
                        cryptocurrency directly on the platform

                    <p>
                        <strong>Crypto Exchanges</strong> - Crypto exchanges offer a brilliant begginner option for those just starting out in the crypto space. With low costs, wide selections of currencies and the option to store directly on the exchange, they are a very popular choice.

                        <strong>Trading Apps</strong> - Trading apps like Robinhood and Webull allow you to purchase select cryptos on their platform with no direct comissions on sales. However, they do charge a spread markup on purchases, to what extent is unclear as they have yet to reveal this information.

                        <strong>Bitcoin ATMs</strong> - Bitcoin ATMs are a less common way to purchase purely bitcoin. They are not linked to any other currencies and are a simple way for people to get involved in the space.
