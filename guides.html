                    <h3>The <i>"Blockchain"</i></h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Before setting out on this journey, there are a few things you should know:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            All cryptocurrencies are created using blockchain technology. A blockchain is like a shared
                            ledger, that works the same way a normal ledger would, but
                            with a fundamental difference.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A traditional ledger's job is to hold a record of transactions, primarily used in banks to
                            record the flow of money. A blockchain acts like a <i>distributed</i> ledger. A distributed
                            ledger is where every point in
                            the chain holds a complete
                            record of every transaction that has ever occured on the chain.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Every point in the chain, (every ledger) is protected with cryptography (special codes) so
                            that no one can tamper with the records on the chain.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If someone does manage to alter a node and break the rules, it doesn't matter, because when
                            the node is checked by the next point on the chain, it's ledger won't be copied as it didnt
                            follow the rules!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This is known as a <i>"peer to peer"</i> system. Which in place from the very beginning of
                            your journey assures that no one can ever tamper with the ledger and full trust is
                            guaranteed without the need for a third party!
                        </li>

                        Here are some of the ways that you can purchase cryptocurrencies:
                    </p>
                    <h3>Financial Apps</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Apps like PayPal or Venmo in the US, allow users to purchase
                            cryptocurrency directly on the platform.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Crypto Exchanges</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Exchanges like Binance and Coinbase offer a brilliant beginner option for those
                            just starting out in
                            the crypto space.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            With low costs, wide selections of currencies and the option to store directly on
                            the exchange, they are a very popular choice.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Trading Apps</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Trading apps like Robinhood and Webull allow you to purchase select cryptos on their
                            platform with no direct comissions on sales.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            However, they do charge a spread markup on purchases, to what extent is unclear as
                            they have yet to reveal this information.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Traditional Brokers</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Some traditional brokers are now giving their users the ability to trade in
                            cryptocurrencies.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This essentially works the same way that a broker would manage a standard stock
                            portfolio.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Bitcoin ATMs</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Bitcoin ATMs are a less common way to purchase purely bitcoin.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            They are not linked to any other currencies and are a simple way for people to get
                            involved in the space.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    Cryptocurrencies can be stored in multiple ways:
                </p>
                <h3>Crypto Wallets</h3>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A crypto wallet works like a physical wallet. It is a safe place where users store their
                        cryptocurrency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A users cryptocurrency is stored in a digital address on the blockchain with special
                        (digital) keys required to access them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        These addresses and keys are provided by the wallet. A crypto wallet can be device, web
                        (internet), or hardware based.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Hot Wallets</h3>
                <hr>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Hot Wallets are crypto wallets that have a connection to the internet. These can be device
                        based (computer or mobile) or web based (online).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Online wallets, are accessible through the web and are managed by an online service.
                        Coinbase, Electrum and Mycelium are a few popular choices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While hot wallets are very convinient and provide access to your crypto from anywhere with
                        an internet connection, there can be security concerns.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Accessing a hot wallet on an internet connection that is not secure may result in having
                        your cryptocurrency stolen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is a good idea to avoid accessing a hot wallet from a public internet connection whenever
                        possible, unless you are sure it is safe!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cold Wallets</h3>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Cold wallets are the simplest and safest way to store your cryptocurrency whilst protecting
                        it from potential attack.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A cold wallet is not connected to the internet and is therefore far less likely to be
                        compromised by a third party.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A cold wallet stores the user's blockchain address and private key in one place and allow
                        them to view their wallet using software that protects their key.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cold wallets are often stored on USB keys and are plugged into a computer to use them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A paper wallet involves the user printing off their private address and keys on a physical
                        piece of paper. Often they are laminated and stored in safety deposit boxes or banks.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Extra security</h3>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Be careful when using cold wallets:</strong> If a user was to lose a cold wallet or
                        its respecting address or keys, there is no way to regain access to your funds. Always make
                        regular backups of your cold wallets to ensure security!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Always keep the software on your devices up to date if you are accessing your wallet using
                        them. Devices running on old software will be an easier target for hackers and malware.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Multi signature wallets allow for transactions to require multiple wallets to sign a
                        transaction. These are especially useful when managing a shared fund, as all parties
                        involved must be in agreement and present when transfering funds.
                    </li>
